                                <h1>How Ruby Duby Glam will protect your personal information</h1>
                                    <p>Ruby Duby Glam will always protect the personal information that you share with us. Ruby Duby Glam stores information internally in a controlled, secure environment. If, for example, you make a purchase online, we route all transactions through SSL (Secure Socket Layers) and process your credit card number only to secure a current payment. The SSL transaction does not retain your credit card number, subsequent to the transaction at hand, and will not use said number for marketing purposes.</p>
                                    <p>We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including: packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver a service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.</p>
                                    <p>If Ruby Duby Glam requests general demographic information, this information is limited to reporting purposes only; members remain anonymous. Phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and postal addresses are never shared for demographic reports with outside entities.</p>
                                    <p>Ruby Duby Glam may occasionally present a special contest or promotion that is sponsored by another company. To qualify for entry, we may ask you to provide personal information. If we plan to share that information with the sponsor(s), we will provide an up-front statement to that effect.</p>
                                    <p>Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, court order or legal process served on our website.</p>
